# Description
Frogger Clone is a re-creation of the classic arcade game Frogger. I wrote the game over the course of a week as my final project in Computer Science II. The project is coded 100% in Java, and was built to showcase an understanding of Object Oriented Programming and Model-View-Controller Architecture.
